# CSCI-571 Web Technologies Projects
These are all of the course projects I did in the CSCI-571 Web Technologies.
## Getting Started
First off, here are some brief descriptions about what each project is about.
### Homework 2 - Homework Page
I created my own [Course Homework Page](http://www-scf.usc.edu/~qingyusu/Crysisun666.html) 
for course graders to check my projects.
### Homework 3 - Imitate A Web Page
In this assignment, I was given an image of a web page. My task was to reproduce the page as closely as possible, wrote HTML and CSS directly without using anything more than a text editor.
### Homework 4 - JSON Exercise
I wrote an HTML/JavaScript program, which took the URL of a JSON document containing Trucking companies information, parsed the JSON file, and extracted the list of trucking companies, displaying them in a table. The JavaScript program was embedded in an HTML file so that it could be executed within a browser.
### Homework 5 - Apache, NGINX, PHP Installation
### Homework 6 - Travel and Entertainment Search Server-side Scripting
In this exercise, I was asked to create a webpage that allows people to search for places information using the Google Places API, and the results will be displayed in a tabular format. The page also provides reviews and photos for the selected place.
### Homework 7 - GCP and AWS configurations
Established the website in HW6 using Google App Engine and Amazonâ€™s Web Services respectively.
### Homework 8 - Ajax, JSON and Responsive Design(Travel and Entertainment Search)
In this exercise I created a webpage that allows users to search for places using the Google Places API and display the results on the same page below the form. Once the user clicks on a button to search for place details, the webpage would display several tabs which contain an info table, photos of the place, map and route search form and reviews respectively. My webpage also support adding places to and removing places from favorites list and posting place info to Twitter. All the implementation details and requirements are explained in the homework 8 section.
